This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## AI Usage Report

# AI Tools Used:
=> ChatGPT: for architecture planning, reusable component logic, and animations

=> GitHub Copilot: for generating boilerplate code and simple utilities

=> v0.dev: used for getting layout ideas for components

# Sample Prompts:

=> “Create a responsive React dashboard widget with export functionality and date filters.”

=> “Build a collapsible FAQ section with Tailwind and Framer Motion.”

=> “Design a modern pricing card section with hover animations using Tailwind CSS.”

## AI vs Manual Work Split:

=> AI-generated (60%): Code structure, animation logic, table/dashboard export logic

=> Manual work (40%): Styling, responsive adjustments, UI tweaks, performance tuning

=> I used AI to speed up development and then customized all suggestions based on design and brand tone. Wherever I felt the AI code was not clean or reusable, I rewrote it manually.
